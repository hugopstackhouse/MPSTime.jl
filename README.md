<h1 align="center"><em>MPSTime.jl</em>: Matrix-Product States for Time-Series Analysis</h1>




[![docs - latest](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-2ea44f)](https://jmoo2880.github.io/MPSTime.jl/dev/)

__MPSTime__ is a Julia package for learning the joint probability distribution of time series directly from data using matrix-product state (MPS) methods inspired by quantum many-body physics. It provides a unified formalism for classifying unseen data, as well as imputing gaps in time-series data, which regularly occur in real-world datasets due to sensor failure, routine maintenance, or other problems.

## Installation
This is not yet a registered Julia package, but it will be soon (TM)! In the meantime, you can install it directly from github:

```Julia

pkg> add https://github.com/jmoo2880/MPSTime.jl.git
