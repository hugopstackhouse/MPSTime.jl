__MPSTime__ is a Julia package for learning the joint probability distribution of time series directly from data using matrix-product state (MPS) methods inspired by quantum many-body physics. 
It provides a unified formalism for classifying unseen data, as well as imputing gaps in time-series data, which regularly occur in real-world datasets due to sensor failure, routine maintenance, or other problems.

## Installation
This is not yet a registered Julia package, but it will be soon (TM)! In the meantime, you can install it directly from github:

```Julia
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/jmoo2880/MPSTime.jl.git
```

## Usage and Documentation
We provide [tutorials](https://joshuabmoore.github.io/MPSTime.jl/dev/tutorial/) and basic usage examples in the documentation:
