# MPSTime.jl
A Julia package for time-series machine learning (ML) using Matrix-Product States (MPS) built on [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl).

MPSTime is a Julia package for learning the joint probability distribution of time series directly from data using matrix product state (MPS) methods inspired by quantum many-body physics. It provides a unified formalism for classifying unseen data, as well as imputing gaps in time-series data, which regularly occur in real-world datasets due to sensor failure, routine maintenance, or other problems.

## Installation
This is not yet a registered Julia package, but it will be soon (TM)! In the meantime, you can install it directly from github:

```Julia
pkg> add https://github.com/jmoo2880/MPSTime.jl.git
```

## Usage
See the [Tutorial](@ref) section and other sidebars for a basic usage examples. We're continually adding more features and documentation as we go.
